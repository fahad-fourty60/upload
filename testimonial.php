							<p><i>He was not keeping well and
									Mr
									Joshi was kind enough to visit home and do all the

									be paid in advance and payment is linked to
									success.ie, when the matter is settled and shares are

									now and he has always blessed Mr Joshi for the good

							<p><i>It is my pleasure and honourto know both Vaibhav and Ashish at ‘Equity solutions’ and they
									have my highest recommendation. I am sure they are already a ‘proven’ asset to their
									organization and also to other fellow Indians like me. I can vouch for them anytime,
									anywhere… They are truly exemplary and true to their company name ‘Equity solutions’ –
									They have solutions and they deliver results! Below is the why …
									I had some complex issues , when i say complex, I mean complexxx – I am talking about
									paper shares that I had bought 25 years ago as an unmarried resident female in India ,
									During these 25 years , I kept the paper shares , did not even open a Demat account,
									changed status from resident to NRI ,changed my name after marriage, moved to a new
									country , changed my postal office address in India , did not notify the companies ,
									Technically I had to prove I was the same person who owned these shares,
									I did not even keep a check on the company and the share prices as , and to add to it the
									company that I was holding shares went through mergers.. if you have been in the equity
									market even for a brief period I am sure you can fathom the complexity of all this .. it would
									be impossible for me to do all this on my own and as I don’t even reside in India, this task
									was mammoth.</i></p>
							<p><i>. I had mentally written this off as bad debts… as not worth the chase..
									And then … I was introduced to Equity solutions. I gave them a brief for barely 20 mins and
									apart from getting some documents and signatures from me, they managed everything,
									sorted out ALL OF THE ABOVE issues, to top it, both Vaibhav and Ashish managed this in
									India while I was away from the country, with a travel ban during Covid period!!! When they
									told me ‘Please check the shares should now reflect in your account, it was nothing short of
									winning a lottery … IT WAS DONE
									I do not have words to express my deep gratitude to both these gentlemen and I am in awe
									of their performance and drive to deliver results, Keep up the good work guys
